      <description>Main FindingsWe set f1-score as the main indicator of the performance of our algorithms. For all 4 algorithms, we have obtained f1-scores above 90%, indicating the reliability of predictions. Accuracies obtained, further corroborate our confidence in the algorithms.

Figure 2: Accuracies of 4 algorithms used

Conclusion and Policy ImplicationsGiven the f1-scores and accuracies above, the project has the potential to create tangible benefit to the municipality.</description>
